# Project: A Comparative Study of Spectral Clustering and K-Means Clustering

## Introduction

Welcome to the project comparing two popular clustering techniques: Spectral Clustering and K-Means Clustering. This project aims to explore and compare these two approaches to data clustering, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and providing practical application examples.

## Project Objectives

1. *Theoretical Understanding:* Delve deep into the theoretical foundations of Spectral Clustering and K-Means Clustering, emphasizing their key concepts, algorithms, and functionalities.

2. *Practical Implementation:* Implement both clustering techniques on real or synthetic datasets. Utilize popular libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, or others as per the project requirements.

3. *Comparative Analysis:* Conduct a thorough comparative analysis of the performance of both methods across different data configurations. Consider factors such as cluster quality, stability, sensitivity to parameters, etc.

4. *Results Visualization:* Employ visualization techniques such as graphs, scatter plots, or heatmaps to illustrate clustering results. This will aid in understanding the differences and similarities between the two methods.

5. *Final Report:* Present the results, conclusions, and recommendations in a clear and concise final report. Include detailed explanations regarding parameter choices, implementation steps, and reasons behind observed performances.
